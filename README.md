# Image-Captioning
This repository contains an implementation of an image captioning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

# Features
Image Feature Extraction: Utilizes a pre-trained CNN (such as VGG16, ResNet, or InceptionV3) to extract high-level features from images.
Caption Generation: Employs LSTM networks to generate natural language descriptions based on the extracted image features.
Web Interface: Provides an easy-to-use web interface built with React for uploading images and displaying captions.
Backend API: FastAPI backend for handling image uploads, running the captioning model, and returning captions.
