# Image Captioning Using LSTM

This repository contains an implementation of an image captioning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, along with a user-friendly web interface built using React and FastAPI. The model generates descriptive captions for images, and the web interface allows users to upload images and view the generated captions.

# Features

Image Feature Extraction: Utilizes a pre-trained CNN (such as VGG16, ResNet, or InceptionV3) to extract high-level features from images.

Caption Generation: Employs LSTM networks to generate natural language descriptions based on the extracted image features.

Web Interface: Provides an easy-to-use web interface built with React for uploading images and displaying captions.

Backend API: FastAPI backend for handling image uploads, running the captioning model, and returning captions.

# Front End

Simple UI using react to upload the images.
